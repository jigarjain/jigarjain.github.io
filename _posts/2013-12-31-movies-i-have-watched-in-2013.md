It’s almost an end to 2013 and I see many topics going around on what they have done or achieved in this year. So I decided to be a part of this ongoing trend, but since I don’t disclose much about my personal life, I would like to share about one thing that I am passionate about(I like to think so) — Movies. I admit that I am not one those hardcore movie watchers who boast of watching 300+ movies a year, but when I say that I make time for myself, I actually mean that I make time for movies. So below is the list of the movies I have watched in 2013. Not all movies below are my first time watch (few are my 4th or even 5th time)
