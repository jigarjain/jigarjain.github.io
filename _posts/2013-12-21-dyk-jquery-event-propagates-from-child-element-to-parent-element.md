If there are 2 events, one on child element & other on parent element, then the event on child element gets called first and then it propagates to the event of parent element. Itâ€™s obvious that any event on parent is also effective on its child. Check out this [fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/H7XKB/1/) demonstrating the same.

To stop the event propagation from child to parent, you can use event.stopPropagation() method provided you are using delegated events and not direct events. Another [fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/H7XKB/2/) shows the event.stopPropagation() method to prevent event bubbling.

For those who want to understand the difference between direct & delegated events, I will guide you to this wonderful explanation on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8110934/direct-vs-delegated-jquery-on/8111171#8111171).
