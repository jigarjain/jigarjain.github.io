title: My Vow of Silence
---

> Archived from old blog

**What**

I will be under the vow of complete silence for 1 whole week. Also during this week, I will be severing various communication channels which includes the phone calls, whatsapp, facebook, twitter etc. But for work & any emergency purpose, I will still be reachable via email.

**When?**

Starting from Sunday, 15th Feb, 2015 till Saturday, 21st Feb 2015.

**Why?**

Honestly, I donâ€™t really have a concrete reason. But this thing has been in my mind for quite a while & I am sure it will be a great learning experience.

**How?**

There is no special plan or preparation done from my side. But yes, people around me are aware of this decision & have supported it very well (It is essential). Also for unforeseen situations, I plan to keep a pen & paper with me via which I should be able to communicate.

This week might be difficult for people around me (especially at my work place) & I really thank them for their encouragement. I might also share my experience at the end of it.

Finally, a quote from Lao Tzu

> Silence is a source of great strength
