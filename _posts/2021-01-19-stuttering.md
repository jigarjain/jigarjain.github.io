Imagine this situation - You are having a terrible day. You are feeling emotionally overwhelmed. You try to somehow cheer yourself up by deciding to go out at a lebanese takeaway place & order a dish called "Foul". You love this dish. Surely it should help you feel better. On a horrible day where nothing was in your control, you finally have that glimmer of happiness that should be within your control. You reach the counter to give your order & you say -

"Ich nehme Ffffffffff..... fffffffff".

The guy looks at you & asks "Schawarma?"

And then you say -

"Nein aber Ffffffffff.......ff"

The guy who is already super busy turns around & carries on with his other tasks. Embarrased, you walk out of the restaurant to practise speaking "Foul". And you do it very fluently on the street outside. After repeating that dish name almost 10 times on street, you decide to give another shot. And you go back in & say -

"Letzt mal, ich hat dass gekauft. Es hei√üt Ffffffffff.....ffffff".


And then you walk out. Feeling like never wanting to go back.
