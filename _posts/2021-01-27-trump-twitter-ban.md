title: Trump Twitter Ban
---

If Digital addiction is a sign of as Mental health disorder, it is interesting to think of the withdrawal symptoms that Donald Trump might be having after his Twitter account was banned. He was clearly very active & probably addicted to Twitter. It was a good* thing that his account was suspended towards the end of his presidency. Imagine a person like him whose favorite toy was forcibly taken away from him & him being the president of a powerful country. Scary.

*I still don't believe his account suspension by Twitter & FB was the right thing.
