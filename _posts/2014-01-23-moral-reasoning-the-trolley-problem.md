title: Moral Reasoning & the ‘Trolley Problem’

> Archived from old blog

I came across this nice lecture which describes about our principles of morality & how we differentiate between right & wrong. One of the best examples was the famous ‘Trolley Problem’ which goes like this.

**Scenario 1:**

As depicted in the picture above, there is a trolley train which, if allowed to travel without intervention, would kill 5 people who are tied down on the track with no chance of escape. But there is a lever, next to which you stand, & if you pull that lever then the train will take a left turn killing 1 person on that track but saving those 5 on the other.

Now the question is whether you will pull the lever & divert the train on other track killing 1 person but saving 5 others or would you just stand without acting on it? Think about the answer before moving ahead to the second scenario.

**Scenario 2:**

Now again there are 5 people who are tied down on a track & there is a trolley train coming which would run over them. But this time you are standing on the bridge right over the track along with a very fat man. The only chance for you to save those 5 men lying on the track is to throw this fat man over the tracks so that the train after running over him would come to an halt(since he is a fat man & this is an hypothetical situation) before reaching till others & thus saving the life of 5 people but again killing 1 person.

Again, the question is whether you will throw that other man off the bridge to save 5 people or would you just see the train crushing those 5 people? Remember, you cannot throw yourself in front of the train.

Most of us would have agreed for pulling the lever to divert the train on the other track & save those 5 people by been aware that it would lead to death of 1 other man. But at the same time many of us would be against the act of throwing that fat man off the bridge to save 5 others. If we study these 2 scenarios we notice that the consequences in both cases are the same — ‘If we act, 1 die, if we don’t then 5 dies’ & yet we act in first scenario but not in the second one. One explanation is that, we humans find it morally right to do something which leads to greater good though it causes unintended harm, but morally wrong to directly do something bad which leads to greater good.

One example would be Abortion. It is morally wrong(crime) to kill the fetus for any personal reason no matter however valid or good it is, because it is a direct bad act to achieve something good. But killing the fetus is acceptable in cases where the life of a mother is in danger and the only way out is to sacrifice the unborn baby because this is an act of achieving something good which results in an inevitable & unintended happening of something bad.

So it seems logical to say that we don’t perform actions based on the consequences but rather they depend on the situations. Because in examples above, 2 different situations have same consequences & yet our actions differ. Many would have an alter arguments here & i will be glad to have your views.
