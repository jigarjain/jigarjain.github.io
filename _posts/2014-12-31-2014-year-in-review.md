title: '2014: Year in Review'

> Archived from old blog

Another year comes to an end. And like many bloggers out there, even I have decided to write this short post as a retrospect of 2014. Also this post is another attempt by me to revive this blog.

In many ways, I would consider 2014 as the most happening (goods & bads) year of my life. It is in this year when I left my first full time job & moved to Bangalore. It is in this year when I had to leave behind my family & friends before coming to this new city. And it wasn’t easy. But it was exciting nevertheless.

We all love short points instead of essays. So here I go:

  - Left ProjectHeena & it’s awesome people back in Mumbai and joined Grallo in Bangalore
  - For first time, started writing apps in JS (NodeJs).
  - Started learning the most important survival skill — Cooking
  - Gave my first [presentation](https://jigarjain.github.io/less-introduction/#/) on CSS
  - Launched this social site [MySanta](https://mysanta.in/)

Also similar to last year, I have watched quite some movies (around 100) & started following many TV series. Daily read Calvin&Hobbes and Dilbert comic strips. 9Gag & Quora were the sites I browsed most. Also started following more cool people on the web. In all, I have been happy with 2014.
Moving in 2015

I would like to keep things simple in 2015. No big resolutions or anything for me. Just 3 things to follow

> Cook more, Eat more & Code more.

It goes without saying that I should also watch more movies.

Lastly, I wish you a very good & better 2015. Hope you find success in your endeavours :)
