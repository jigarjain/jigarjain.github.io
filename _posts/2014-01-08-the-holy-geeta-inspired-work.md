I have been reading the ‘The Holy Geeta’ which is also considered as ‘A User’s Manual for Every Day Living’ and came across this nice few lines which explains what exactly is the ‘Inspired Work’ or ‘Masterpiece’. Below I have shared those lines.

 > It is very well known that in all activities, inspired work gathers to itself a texture of divine perfection which cannot be imitated or oft-repeated. Be he a poet, or an artist, a doctor or a speaker, irrespective of his profession, whenever an individual is at his best, his master-piece is always accepted by all as a ‘work of inspiration’. When we thus work with the thrilled ecstasy of an unknown mood called ‘inspiration’, the ideas, thoughts and activity that come out of us have a ringing beauty of their own, which cannot be otherwise mechanically repeated by us. Thus, Da Vinci could not repeat for a second time and copy on another piece of canvas the enigmatic smile of his Mona Lisa; Keats’ pen could no more re-capture for a second time the song of the Nightingale in its flight; Beethoven could never again beat out of his faithful piano a second Moonlight Sonata; Lord Krishna himself, after the war, when requested by Arjuna to repeat the Geeta, admitted his inability to do so!!
 > To the western mind and understanding, ‘inspiration’ is an accidental and mysterious happening over which the mortal has no control at all. To the eastern Rishis, inspired living is the real godly destiny of man, when he lives in perfect unison with the Self within him. A balanced life, wherein we live as unaffected witnesses of even our own mind and intellect, is the realm of self-forgetfulness, where, instead of becoming inefficient, our profession gathers the scintillating glow of a new dawn. This extra aura in any achievement is that which raises an ordinary success to an ‘inspired achievement.’

Here the inspiration is not used in the context of seeing someone or thinking something and getting inspired to do it (motivation). Rather it’s about been in that mind space where whatever you do, it comes out beautifully with perfection.
Now if the question is on how to achieve that thrilled ecstasy so that we can do things beautifully, The Holy Geeta points us in the direction of Yoga(Meditation). But I would leave you with this food for thought –
