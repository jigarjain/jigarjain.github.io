title: Why I love to host on DigitalOcean ?

> Archived from old blog

I have been using DigitalOcean since March 2013 for ProjectHeena and I have always loved it and its community. But I have always faced one question from my other developer friends who are using AWS or Rackspace or other VPS services. The question is, “Is DigitalOcean really good?” And hence the below blog post to answer that question. Consider it as a write down of my personal experience with DO.

**What it offers**
**Low Pricing** — Have you ever heard about running your own Cloud Machine for $5/Month. Even I didn’t, before I came across DigitalOcean. We tested out our Beta product on $5 machine and it was perfect. In fact this very site you are reading is on same config. Their entire pricing model is very light on pockets. The only thing that is heavy is their performance.

**Ease of Use** — Now since I haven’t used other cloud services as much as I have used DO, I won’t say that launching the cloud servers with other service providers is difficult, but thanks to the extensive documents of DO and their easy to use GUI, launching a droplet (instance) could never have been more easy than that for me.

**Excellent Tech Support** — Whether it is about launching your own cloud machine or installing your favorite programming stack on it, there is always some space for goofing up the things. And during that time, we expect a batman to come up and help us get out of it. Though there is no paid tech support model by them, they still try to answer to your tickets as promptly as they can.

**Documentations and Tutorials** — Now this is one thing which I like the most about DigitalOcean. Within a short time, they have built such an extensive library of tutorials of almost everything you can do after creating your first instance. Be it installing any server or any language or any database or any other services. As per my estimate, there is at least 5–6 new tutorials posted every week on their community forum. And you even get paid to write one. Yes, you heard it right.

**Automated Backups** — Now am not sure how many other services provides automated backup of your entire instance, but thanks to this feature of DO since it has saved my day once. Many of us have done those `rm -rf` mistakes and so did I which deleted my archived code. Thanks to backups that were taken by DO, which helped me to get my code back.


**What I would like to see**
**Other Payment Options** — I don’t have Credit Card and PayPal doesn’t accept my Debit Card. So how do I access your services? There have to be an option for Debit Card or Internet Banking. I know others might not be having it, but then others don’t even have $5/Month plans. :P

**Other Services** — It would really be great to see other services like CDN or automated load balancer etc to be available out of the box in the coming future.

**More Data Centers** — I know I am been greedy here, but it would be great to have a Data Center of DO in Asia like others have in Singapore. That would just be awesome.

It’s been almost a year since I have been with DO and I absolutely love it. I would also like to thank the entire community behind DO for helping me out and specially Etel, Kamal & Bulat for their help and patience in every problem I faced. You guys rock!! :)
