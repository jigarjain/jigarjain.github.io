title: Baking II - Banana Muffins
---

Another attempt at baking. This time, I made a [vegan banana muffins](https://www.thespruceeats.com/basic-vegan-banana-muffins-3378253) with a dash of raisins & cashews sprinkled over it. I am quite happy with the result. Next time, I do plan to add more  to the dough.
