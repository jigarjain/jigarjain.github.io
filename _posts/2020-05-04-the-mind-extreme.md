title: The Mind "Extreme"
---

It was a fun evening yesterday with friends & food. After having played the game "The Mind" over 2 years ago, a friend brought a newer version of this game called "The Mind - Extreme". It was more fun & I absolutely loved the "Blind" mode. I would like to explore more such co-op board/card games.
