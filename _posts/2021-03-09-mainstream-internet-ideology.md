title: Mainstream/Internet Ideology
---

I believe myself to be a fairly liberal person. It has mostly been due to the different perspective & new age understanding that I have received from Internet. But in last couple of years, I grow more distant with the current ideology that is often found in my internet circle. Every single thing that is reported is biased towards an agenda. Neutrality has lost in reporting. Current mentality is "If you aren't with us, you are with them". Guess what? I am not with them because they are ignorant. And I am not with you because you are delusional. List of things which happened more recently that I currently don't agree with

- Twitter ban of Trump while he was a publicly elected president
- Parler been kicked off Google/AWS platform immediately afterward? Why didn't that happen much earlier given the problems raised
- CJI shamed for his "marry the rape victim" remark which was widely reported but completely taken out of context.
